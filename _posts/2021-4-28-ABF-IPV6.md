What is ABF?
Examples were taken on IOS-XR 7.3.1.

### How is it working
eXR platforms are powered with Linux kernel, and includes Python. Let's start slowly, and call a show clock in python. To find the system version of your favorite IOS-XR regular command, you can use the command "describe" :

## Cisco 8000 ABF Behavior

Small refresh on how to do an EEM script. Don't forget your aaa configuration! You will also need a user able to execute a script. In a nutshell :

~~~
event manager environment _cron_entry */1 * * * *
event manager directory user policy disk0:/script
event manager policy eem_throttle.tcl username cisco persist-time 3600 type user
!
aaa authorization eventmanager default local
~~~

What are those commands?
+ event manager **environment** is the variable that our script will call. It helps us manage the cron value we are going to use dynamically.
+ event manager **directory** is where all the file related to our EEM are going to be located.
+ event manager **policy** is the declaration of our script, where cisco is the user.


### Workaround

To sum up, we used python to get usual CLI output, EEM Script to schedule when we want to play our script, and once again, python to react to the output. It is now up to you to use python on your XR device to solve your real life use cases!
