![Blowing in the wind](/images/blowinginthewind.jpg){:height="256px" width="256px"}


I am Alain, 32 years old network engineer working for Cisco. I also used to reload routers and find lost packets for Orange, Monaco Telecom, and Criteo. I am cheering for NoOps, NetDevOps and AS MONACO FOOTBALL CLUB. I like to cook what I am eating, brew what I am drinking, and hole-in-one what I am swinging.

I am living in Cannes, France.
